Lesson 1. Introduction:

1.1. What is jQuery?
- jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", javascript Library
- make it easier to use JS on website
- The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities

1.2. Why jQuery?
jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Lesson 2. jQuery Get Started
2.1. Adding jquery to your web pages
There are several way to start using jQuery on your website.
- Download jQuery form jQuery.com
- Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google

The jQuery library is a single JS file, you can reference it with the HTML <script> tag in side <head> section

2.2. jQuery CDN
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network)
Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:
url: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js

3.1 jQuery Syntax
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s)
tailor-made /ˌteɪlər ˈmeɪd/ thiết kế riêng

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()
 A $ sign to define/access jQuery
 A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML element
 A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)


Example:
$(this).hide() - hide the current element.
$("p").hide() - hide all <p> elements.
$("#test").hide() - hide all elements with id test.
$(".test").hide() - hide all elements with id test.


3.2 The Document Ready Event
You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:

$(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});
This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.

Here are some examples of actions that can fail if methods are run before the document is fully loaded:

Trying to hide an element that is not created yet
Trying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet
Tip: The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the document ready event:

$(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});
Use the syntax you prefer. We think that the document ready event is easier to understand when reading the code.
